# Getting Started
A step by step guide to get Ziggy up and running your Zig project.

## Fetching the package
Before we continue, ensure you have at least version `0.14.0` of Zig installed.

To add Ziggy to your project you can use `zig fetch` like so
```sh
zig fetch --save git+https://github.com/kristoff-it/ziggy.git
```
This will fetch latest version of Ziggy into your project, you can verify this by looking into `build.zig.zon`
```zig
.dependencies = .{
    // ...
    .ziggy = .{
        .url = "git+https://github.com/kristoff-it/ziggy.git#COMMIT",
        .hash = "ziggy-0.1.0-HASH",
    },
    // ...
},
```
Both `COMMIT` and `HASH` will be different

## Setting up `build.zig`
After you have successfully fetch ziggy package, open up `build.zig` and search for your executable module variable e.g. `exe_mod` (this should be the case in freshly created Zig project)

Once you have located your executable module variable, let's add the dependency into our project
```zig
const ziggy_dep = b.dependency("ziggy", .{
    .target = target,
    .optimize = optimize,
});
```
Now just add it to the executable module as an import using `addImport` like so
```zig
exe_mod.addImport("ziggy", ziggy_dep.module("ziggy"));
```
Again, `exe_mod` may be called differently in your project
