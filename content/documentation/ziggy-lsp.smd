# `ziggy lsp`

Ziggy diagnostics, documentation and autocompletion for your editor.

## Development status
Main features implemented, some autocomplete behavior could be improved.

Not fully tested, users could experience bugs.


## Detection of Ziggy Schemas
The LSP will automatically pick up the schema for a document if both share the same name and location.

Suppose that your application has a config file located at `~/.config/myapp/config.ziggy`. If your application also generates `~/.config/myapp/config.ziggy-schema`, then your users will automatically get diagnostics, docs and autocompletion support when opening `config.ziggy`.
