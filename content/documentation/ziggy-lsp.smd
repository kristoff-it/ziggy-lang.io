Ziggy diagnostics, documentation and autocompletion for your editor.

## Detection of Ziggy Schemas
Ziggy tooling looks for matching Ziggy Schemas in two ways:

1. Document and Schema share the same file name and are placed in the same
   directory (e.g. `foo.ziggy` -> `foo.ziggy-schema`), like before.
2. Presence of a Ziggy Schema named `.ziggy-schema` which will apply to all Ziggy
   Documents in the subtree that do not have a Schema file with the same name (or
   another .ziggy-schema file closer to them).
