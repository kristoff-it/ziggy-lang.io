# VSCode

Make sure the [Ziggy CLI tool](/documentation/getting-started/) is available in your `PATH`, then [download the Ziggy VSCode extension from the official marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=LorisCro.ziggy).


If you don't see LSP diagnostics when editing Ziggy files, it means that VSCode could not find the `ziggy` executable.
