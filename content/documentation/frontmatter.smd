All Ziggy pasers support parsing a Ziggy document used as frontmatter in an
external document file format, like SuperMD.

This is what a frontmatter looks like in SuperMD:

```md
---
.title = "Frontmatter",
.date =  "2025-03-11T19:11:59",
.author = "",
.draft = false,
.layout = "documentation.shtml",
.tags = [],
---
Your **SuperMD** content goes here.
```

As you can see the Ziggy document is framed by two `---` delimiters.

The Ziggy LSP can be configured to run on SuperMD files and it will correctly
provide diagnostics for the frontmatter section of the document.


See the frontmatter-related options in `ziggy.Ast` and `ziggy.Parser` to learn
how to parse a Ziggy frontmatter out of an external document.
