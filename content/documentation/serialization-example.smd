# Serialization Example
First import `ziggy` (see [Getting Started](getting-started-dev) to learn how to add Ziggy as a dependency):
```zig
const ziggy = @import("ziggy");
```

## Serializing
`ziggy.serialize` is the function that turns a Zig value into a Ziggy document.

Usage is extremely straight-forward, just make sure to read the relative doc comments.

In case you want to serialize a value but keep it in memory, you can use `std.Io.Writer.Allocating`:

```zig
var out: std.Io.Writer.Allocating = .init(gpa);
defer out.deinit();

try ziggy.serialize(foo, .{}, output_buffer.writer());
```
The second parameter of the function can be used to configure the Serializer, its type is `ziggy.Serializer.Options`

To get our result, simply read from `out.written()`
```zig
std.debug.print("{s}\n", .{out.written()});
```
