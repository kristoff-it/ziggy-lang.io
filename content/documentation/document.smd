# Ziggy Document File Structure


## File Extension
A Ziggy Document file have a `ziggy` file extension.


## Contents
A Ziggy Document encodes one Ziggy value. A very common choice is to encode a struct in a Ziggy Document, but in fact a Ziggy Document can be an array, a dictionary, a bytes literal or even just a single `null`.

The following are all valid Ziggy Documents:

```ziggy
"hello world"
```

```ziggy
42
```

```ziggy
{
  "this": "is",
  "a": "dict",
}
```



```ziggy
[
  .{ .more = "structs" }, 
  .{ .more = "glory" },
]
```


## Comments
Ziggy allows you to put comments in a document.
Ziggy comments are all single-line (there's no multi-line comment syntax, you're welcome).

```ziggy
.foo = bar,
//.bar = baz,
.tags = [
  "tag1", // foo
  "tag3", // foobar
  // baz
],
```
