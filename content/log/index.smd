## About
This is a non-exhaustive, curated list of changes meant to help users quickly see what has improved since they last checked.

Refer to [the repository](https://github.com/kristoff-it/ziggy) and the [issue tracker](https://github.com/kristoff-it/ziggy/issues) for more in-depth information.


## 2025-03-11
Improved Ziggy frontmatter parsing. Previously we were considering the frontmatter
framing delimiters `---` as external text that the Ziggy parser should not concern
itself with, but it turns out that it's a great idea to add them as tokens to the
tokenizer and instructing parsers to be aware when attempting to parse a Ziggy
document embedded as frontmatter in an external document (e.g. SuperMD).

See [documentation/frontmatter/](documentation/frontmatter) for more info.
